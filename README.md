# 32bit_RISC_processor-BETA
# BETA procesor is a 32 bit RISC based processor proposed on Beta ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) of MIT, USA.
#  The objective of this github project is to bring designers from different countries enrolled with MIT Research Center at one platform and devlop a very well documented and fully synthesizable RTL model of beta processor. I will be core devloper but intuitive ideas are always welcome. You can start branch and send pull requests. Depending upon the implementation they will be approved time to time.

- The model should be highly configurable so that it become a good choice for SoC (System-on-a-chip) designs and advanced FPGAs as well. 
- A thorough code will be written in verilog for each sub-modules, additionaly testbench will also be written in Verilog to verify the functinality of each sub-modules using Cadence Tool Suit, Model-Sim Simulator & ISE Tool from Xilinx. Later the FPGA and ASIC synthesis will be done using other synthesis tools like Synplify Pro and Xilinx tool suits.
- NOTE: First basic version of beta will be devloped that is without pipelining. The design for pipelined version also completed but the devlopement will start after release of the first version.

# Present Status: Primary Sub-modules of proposed porcessor like Control Unit,Registor file, Program Counter, ALU etc has been devloped and verified. Now we are on synthesis.
