# 32bit_RISC_processor-BETA
# BETA procesor is a 32 bit RISC based processor designed for educational purposes, specificailly for 6.004 course by MIT, USA.
#  The objective of this github project is to devlop a very well documented and fully synthesizable Verilog HDL model of beta processor. 

- The model should be highly configurable so that it become a good choice for SoC (System-on-a-chip) designs and for purely educational purposes. 
- A thorough code will be written in verilog for each sub-modules, additionaly testbench will also be written in Verilog to verify the functinality of each sub-modules using Model-Sim Simulator & ISE Tool from Xilinx. Later the FPGA and ASIC synthesis will be done using other synthesis tools like Synplify Pro and Xilinx tool suits.
# NOTE: First basic version of beta will be designed that is without pipelining. 

# Present Status: Ist Phase- Basic Sub-modules of beta like Control Unit, ALU etc are under devlopment.
